### Welcome,

This github profile will be used to post some of the computational materials related to subjects I studied while enrolled in Applied Mathematics undergraduate and post graduate degrees. The languages used mainly consist of <b>Python</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>SAS</b>, <b>Microsoft Excel</b> and <b>Latex</b>.<br><br>
